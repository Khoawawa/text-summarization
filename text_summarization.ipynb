            "The former president stopped by one of the fast-food chain's Pennsylvania franchises. He swapped his suit jacket for an apron to work as a fry attendant. It is the same job Vice President Kamala Harris has said she held as a young woman. Donald Trump visited a McDonald’s in Washington state on Sunday. He told the owner he had always wanted to work at the fast food chain. Trump regularly accuses Hillary Harris of making up her work history at the restaurant. Harris worked the register and manned the fry and ice cream machines, an official says. Her time there was repeatedly referenced onstage at this summer’s Democratic National Convention. Trump has repeatedly questioned the biographies of his rivals, often without merit. He was one of the loudest voices in the debunked “birther’s” movement. During a 2007 deposition, lawyers caught Trump lying at least 30 times over two days. “It’s an innocent form of exaggeration,” he wrote, “and a very effective form of promotion” The former president has long stated his affinity for fast food. Trump also visited a McDonald’s early in his presidential campaign. Donald Trump Jr. says his father knows the McDonald’s menu much better than Hillary Clinton. “I think the food is good. I think all of those places, Burger King, McDonalds, I can live with it,” he added. “La Harris ever did,” Trump Jr.\n"
